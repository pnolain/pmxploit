================================================================================================

The goal of PMXploit is to facilitate NONMEM post-processing analysis. It provides helper functions for visualizing and summarizing population analyses results, detecting outliers, computing numerical quality criteria and comparing multiple run results.

It is compatible with run executed with NONMEM 7.2 and higher.

Requirements
------------

To take full advantage of `pmxploit` capacities, users should mind applying some "conventions" in writing NONMEM control stream files (see [article](articles/nonmem_requirements.html)).
